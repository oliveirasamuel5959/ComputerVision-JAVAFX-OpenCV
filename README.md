<h1>Computer Vision Project using JavaFX and BufferedImage Class</h1>
<h2>Java Image Processing application to alter pixels values on images using
  BufferedImage Java Class and JavaFX
</h2>

<h3>The main goal of this project is to apply make a properly image processing
applying convolution, image enhancement and pixel by pixel change. To understand
how digital images works in the form of matrix and be able to change its pixels values 
to achieve a desirable result.</h3>
